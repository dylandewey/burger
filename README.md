# Killer Burgers!
## [GitHub](https://github.com/dylandewey/burger.git)
This app uses a database to keep track of burgers the user would like to eat.  The user is then able to say if the burger has been devoured or has not yet been devoured.  The user can then delete burgers from devoured or not devoured.  The app has been deployed through heroku.
I was able to get this app to function but it's very bland.  I'll add it to my portfolio but I definitely need to add more styling to make it look more professional.
